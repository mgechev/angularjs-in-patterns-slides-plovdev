<h2>Controllers</h2>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
The AngularJS controllers are JavaScript functions which help handling the user interactions with the web application (for example mouse events, keyboard events, etc.) by attaching methods to the scope. All required external components, for the controllers are provided through the Dependency Injection mechanism of AngularJS.
